Function pointers are a powerful feature in C and C++ that allow you to treat functions as variables, essentially enabling you to pass functions as arguments to other functions or store them in data structures. Instead of passing data, you pass the address of a function, which can then be invoked later in the program. This provides flexibility and enables the implementation of advanced programming techniques like callbacks and function tables. Understanding function pointers is crucial for mastering these languages and delving into more complex programming scenarios.
